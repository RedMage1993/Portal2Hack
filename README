This hack allows a user to change the velocity of their character in single-player mode on Portal 2.

I've uploaded a demo video to YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aLCpCKeQ8w

I believe Portal 2 has been updated/patched since my public release of this tool, so the offsets/pointers used in my source code may be off a little.
