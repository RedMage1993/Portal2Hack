This hack allows a user to change the velocity of their character in single-player mode on Portal 2.

I've uploaded a demo video to YouTube: https://youtu.be/_aLCpCKeQ8w?t=2m31s

I believe Portal 2 has been updated/patched since my public release of this tool, so the offsets/pointers used in my source code may be off a little.

<strong>More details, images, and/or animated GIFs coming soon.</strong>
